# jy-portfolio

Welcome to the README for my portfolio website.

Built in React and using mainly React-Three/Fiber and React-Three/Drei.
I used these libraries to create the canvas element which renders a 3d environment.
The html content floats serenely over the top by the use of the glorious z-index attribute.

Feel free to clone this repo if you *really* want!

Be sure to run 'npm install' once cloned as there are a hefty few packages that you'll be missing.
